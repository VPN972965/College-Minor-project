# V - Reflection Testing Tool

V is a tool designed to test web applications for reflection vulnerabilities. It sends a payload to a URL and checks if the payload is reflected in the response. 

## Features

- **Concurrency:** Test multiple URLs simultaneously with configurable concurrency.
- **Verbose Mode:** Detailed output for each request, useful for debugging.
- **Custom Headers:** Add custom headers to requests.
- **Proxy Support:** Route requests through a proxy.
- **User Agent:** Set a custom User-Agent string for requests.
- **Output to File:** Save results to a specified output file.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/v-tool.git
cd v-tool

Usage

V can be run from the command line with various options:
python3 v.py -c 50 -p "V" -o output.txt -d "param=value" -x "http://127.0.0.1:8080" -u "CustomUserAgent" -H "Header1: Value1" -H "Header2: Value2"

Options

-c: Set the concurrency level (default: 50)
-v: Enable verbose mode
-p: Payload to send to check reflection (default: "V")
-o: Output file to save results
-d: Request data for POST based reflection testing
-x: Proxy URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080)
-u: Custom User-Agent string (default: Mozilla/5.0 ...)
-H: Set custom headers
cat urls.txt | python3 v.py -c 20 -p "VTest" -o results.txt -x "http://127.0.0.1:8080" -u "CustomUserAgent" -H "Authorization: Bearer token"
This command reads URLs from urls.txt, tests them with a concurrency of 20, uses "VTest" as the payload, saves results to results.txt, routes requests through a proxy, sets a custom User-Agent, and adds an Authorization header.

Output

Results will be printed to the console or saved to the specified output file in the following format:
http://example.com/path?param=VTest
If verbose mode is enabled, additional details about each request and response will be printed.
